# ABOUT THE PROJECT 🚀
The idea is to develop a program dedicated to LaLiga where matches, players, coaches, etc., can be managed. We will have three types of users: Administrator, Coach, and Player. Each of these users will have their respective options and permissions to carry out actions within the system.
